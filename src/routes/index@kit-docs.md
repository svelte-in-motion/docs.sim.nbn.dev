## Real Videos, no Widgets

Svele-In-Motion uses the ever prevalent [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/) to create `.mp4`, `.webm`, etc files that you can upload and embed anywhere! And, it uses the excellent [ffmpeg.wasm](https://github.com/ffmpegwasm/ffmpeg.wasm) to run the whole workflow in your Browser.

## In-Browser or On Desktop

From creation to video rendering, Svelte-In-Motion's workflow can run completely in your Browser locally. Or, you can download a packaged desktop version powered by [Tauri](https://tauri.studio) from [Releases](https://github.com/novacbn/svelte-in-motion/releases).

## Realtime Previews and Editing

Svelte-In-Motion provides an IDE so you never have to leave the application for anything. With a functional virtual filesystem and code editor.

## Programatic Video Creation

Since all Svelte-In-Motion videos are just [Svelte](https://svelte.dev) Components and regular Web Platform, you can create videos to exact specifications.
