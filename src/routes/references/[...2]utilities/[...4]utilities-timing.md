# {$frontmatter.title}

Helper utilities for random generation related tasks are provided.

## Imports

```typescript
import {
    animation,
    debounce,
    idle,
    throttle,
    timeout,
} from "@svelte-in-motion/utilities";
```

## `animation`

```typescript
export const animation: () => Promise<void>;
```

Returns a `Promise` that resolves **BEFORE** the Browser's next repaint.

```typescript
import {animation} from "@svelte-in-motion/utilities";

await animation();

console.log("I was logged before the next frame!");
```

## `debounce`

```typescript
export const debounce: <
    F extends (...args: any[]) => any | Promise<any>
>(
    func: F,
    duration: number = 0
) => (...args: Parameters<F>) => void | Promise<void>;
```

Returns a wrapper function that does **NOT** execute `func` function first until after the `duration` in milliseconds has elapsed since the **LATEST** call.

```typescript
import {debounce} from "@svelte-in-motion/utilities";

const wrapped_function = debounce(
    (name) => `Hello ${name}!`,
    250
);

wrapped_function("John"); // N/A

wrapped_function("Jane"); // N/A

wrapped_function("World"); // `Hello World!`
```

## `idle`

:::

```typescript
export const idle: () => Promise<void>;
```

Returns a `Promise` that resolves **AFTER** the Browser's event loop goes idle.

```typescript
import {idle} from "@svelte-in-motion/utilities";

await idle();

console.log("I was eventually logged!");
```

## `throttle`

```typescript
export const throttle: <
    F extends (...args: any[]) => any | Promise<any>
>(
    func: F,
    duration: number = 0
) => (...args: Parameters<F>) => void | Promise<void>;
```

Returns a wrapper function that does **NOT** execute the inner `func` function again until after the `duration` in milliseconds has elapsed since the **LAST** call.

```typescript
import {
    throttle,
    timeout,
} from "@svelte-in-motion/utilities";

const wrapped_function = throttle(
    () => "I was called!",
    250
);

wrapped_function(); // `I was called!`

wrapped_function(); // N/A

await timeout(250);

wrapped_function(); // `I was called!`
```

## `timeout`

```typescript
export const timeout: (delay: number) => Promise<void>;
```

Returns a `Promise` that resolves **AFTER** the `delay` in milliseconds has elapsed.

```typescript
import {timeout} from "@svelte-in-motion/utilities";

await timeout(1500);

console.log("I was logged 1.5s later!");
```
