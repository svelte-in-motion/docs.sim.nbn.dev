# {$frontmatter.title}

`playing` is a [Svelte Store](https://svelte.dev/docs#run-time-svelte-store-writable) that signifies if the video is playing.

## Imports

```typescript
import {
    CONTEXT_PLAYING,
    playing,
} from "@svelte-in-motion/core";
```

## Definitions

```typescript
export const playing: (
    value?: boolean
) => Writable<boolean>;
```

## Usage

```typescript
import {playing} from "@svelte-in-motion/core";

const playing_store = playing(false);
```

## `CONTEXT_PLAYING`

`CONTEXT_PLAYING` handles making a new `playing` store based on the current [Svelte Context](https://svelte.dev/docs#run-time-svelte-setcontext).

```typescript
export const CONTEXT_PLAYING: {
    has: () => boolean;

    get: () => Writable<boolean>;

    set: (playing: Writable<boolean>) => void;
};
```

### `CONTEXT_PLAYING.has`

`CONTEXT_PLAYING.has` returns if there are available `playing` Store in the current Context.

```svelte
<script>
    import {CONTEXT_PLAYING} from "@svelte-in-motion/core";

    const IS_AVAILABLE = CONTEXT_PLAYING.has();
</script>
```

### `CONTEXT_PLAYING.get`

`CONTEXT_PLAYING.get` returns the `playing` Store from the current Context, if available.

```svelte
<script>
    import {CONTEXT_PLAYING} from "@svelte-in-motion/core";

    const playing_store = CONTEXT_PLAYING.get();
</script>
```

### `CONTEXT_PLAYING.set`

`CONTEXT_PLAYING.set` assigns a `playing` Store to the current Context.

```svelte
<script>
    import {
        CONTEXT_PLAYING,
        playing,
    } from "@svelte-in-motion/core";

    const playing_store = playing(false);

    CONTEXT_PLAYING.set(playing_store);
</script>
```
